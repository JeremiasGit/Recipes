      <li>Passo 1: Combine warm water and yeast in a large bowl;stir to dissolve. Add war milk,egg,marmalade, and butter.Stir to continue</li>
      <li>Passo: Mix flour, oats, and salt together in a separate bowl.Add yeast mixture and stir until moistened. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat both sides. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes
      <li>Passo: Meanwhile, combine cranberries, brown sugar, and water in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until cranberries begin to soften, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat;stir in walnuts, butter, and lemon juice. Let cool.</li>
      <li>Passo: Punch dough down. Roll dough into a 10x20-inch rectangle on a floured surface.</li>
      <li>Passo: Whisk egg white and water together. Brush lightly over the dough. Spread cranberry filling over the dough, leaving a 1-inchhhh border on all sides. Roll up tightly, starting from a long edge. Seal edges and cut off any tapered sides with no filling.</li>
      <li>Passo: Transfer roll to a large square baking sheet. Join ends together to form a ring. Use sharp kitcher shears to make cuts at 1-inch intervals, cutting 2/3 of the way through the dough. Twist each slice gently to expose the swirled filling. Gently shape dough into a perfect ring. Cover and let rise until doubled, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>Passo: Prehead the over to 350 degrees F (175 graus C).</li>
      <li>Passo: Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack. Let cool completely.</li>
      <li>Passo: Stir powdered sugar and orange juice concentrate together in a small bowl. Add enough water to reach a glaze-like consistency. Drizzle glaze over tea ring. Allow glaze to set before slicing</li>
